# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository serves as a blueprint for a booking management system, created as part of the FeatureForge project. It details the process of requirement analysis, from defining functional and non-functional requirements to visualizing system interactions through diagrams.

The goal is to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the initial phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring a solid foundation for successful software development.
